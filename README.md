# Metacritic-AI
An AI that guesses metacritic scores based purely on the title. Use critic.py to train a model and tester.py to test the the model. A trained model I made myself is included and tester.py uses it by default. You input a title for a hypothetical game and the program will use the knowledge it gained from looking at a bunch of games on Metacritic to guess what score it would get from 1-100. This is obviously unrealistic, but funny nonetheless.
